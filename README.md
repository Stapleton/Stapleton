# ðŸ‘‹ Yo! Iâ€™m Stapleton, I am a 24 y/o Self-Taught Computer Scientist
### If doing it and learning it makes the dopamine go brr, then im gonna do it and learn it.

I tried turning on the home computer at 2 years old. Filled up my first hard drive at 4.
Learned how audio drivers matter at 5. Spun up my first minecraft server at 9.
Installed and experimented with Ubuntu at 12. Started learning HTML/CSS/JS at 13.
Started my first 3 coding projects and working with the IT Admin in my High School at 15.
Was a non-profit Server Administrator for Twitch Streamers at 16. Had 9 clients at peak.
Built my first computer at 17. At 18 I started working with Java, C# and Typescript.
Built 3 more computers at 19. Had my first long term stable homelab running on enterprise equipment at 20.

Today at 24, I am learning proper CyberSec practices,
teaching my college friends since their paid classes aren't doing a good job,
writing tools for video games, learning how to make games with Godot,
and blueprinting a new project for sending controller inputs over the local network.

Does that count as a prodigy?
