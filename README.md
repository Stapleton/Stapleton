### A lil Backstory
I had been learning everything I could about computers from a very young age. I went from breaking them to maintaining to building to programming them.
I was also a server administrator for partnered Twitch streamers for free; my skills were a lil underdeveloped but I wanted the experience and to learn.
In the end, I peaked at 8 concurrent clients, 3 of which averaged 300 viewers per stream, and each client had at least 2 servers, the most a client had was 8 total servers.
My earlier knowledge was from hosting servers for myself and my friends. I would repurpose old computers from my high school; put ubuntu server and it can do so much.
I started with programming batch scripts, and then I tried C++ and it was too much, so I went to HTML/CSS/JS to start and found more interest in the overall depth of JS.
Around the same time of learning about NodeJS, the boys and I needed a musicbot that didnt suck. I decided to make a musicbot just for the homies and I.
The fallback of public musicbots was just that, they were public. They hadnt matured enough to handle thousands of audio streams let alone tens of thousands.
Hence NonShitMusicBot was born. Its duty was its name. Be a Non Shit Music Bot. Ironically, it was the worst thing we ever used. It was a Shit Music Bot.

### My Passion Project
Am I suprised that NonShitMusicBot was actually hot garbage? no. I wrote the first version on my Galaxy S6 with a bluetooth keyboard in my room.
400 lines of repeat spaghetti code. Had a specific order of actions otherwise it would break. The pitfalls of JS would eventually be the downfall.
However, I hadn't anticipated NonShitMusicBot (NSMB) was gonna pique my interest so much, especially since it showed me what NodeJS was capable of.
As I learned more and more programming paradigms, the more I used the new skills in my bot which would forever push it into "rewrite hell".
It will never be finished as I will never be finished learning. My Passion Project is an actual timeline of my growth as a comp scientist.
NSMB got rewritten into DJStapleton since having a cuss word in the name wasn't all that great. Many rewrites happened. The next most notable one being...
Alloybot. It was moving away from being "just a musicbot" and towards a module loader. A bot you could add modules to, to make it do anything you want.
At the time, Twitch was implementing Extensions which lead me to think that having a chat bot that was actually capable of being a discord musicbot, 
a twitch chat mod, log keeper, game server/irc bridge, literally anything. If you could code it, it could be it. I tried to even sell the concept to Twitch.
Some friends and I thought we could go all the way with it, so we made actual product accounts, some shitty logos, and a git team.
We then got nothing done with it, and Alloybot as a Twitch product was a dying dream. I then kept it going for myself again.
It was around the last couple iterations of Alloybot where I started to experiment with other languages. I tried C#, Python, Typescript, and Java.
I ended up choosing Typescript as my next language. C# and Java are the next couple I'd like to learn. I started Hellbot in Typescript.
After some work into Hellbot, I started to burn out since I had rewritten the bot something like 12 times at that point and was sick of the same shit every time.
I stopped programming for a long while, and then I decided to come back to it and start a brand new project that inherits features of every previous iteration of the passion project.
Toolkit was born. I personally think its becoming quite the showcase of my skillset for programming.
